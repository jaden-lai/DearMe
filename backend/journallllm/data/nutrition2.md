One measurement of food quality is the amount of nutrients it 
contains relative to the amount of energy it provides. High-quality 
foods are nutrient-dense, meaning they contain significant amounts 
of one or more essential nutrients relative to the amount of calories 
they provide. Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of “empty
calorie” foods such as carbonated sugary soft drinks, which provide 
many calories and very little, if any, other nutrients. Food quality is 
additionally associated with its taste, texture, appearance, microbial 
content, and how much consumers like it. 
Food: A Better Source of Nutrients 
It is better to get all your micronutrients from the foods you eat 
as opposed to from supplements. Supplements contain only what is 
14  |  Food Quality
listed on the label, but foods contain many more macronutrients, 
micronutrients, and other chemicals, like antioxidants, that benefit 
health. While vitamins, multivitamins, and supplements are a $20 
billion industry in the United States, and more than 50 percent 
of Americans purchase and use them daily, there is no consistent 
evidence that they are better than food in promoting health and 
preventing disease.

In addition to nutrition, health is affected by genetics, the 
environment, life cycle, and lifestyle. One facet of lifestyle is your 
dietary habits. Recall that we discussed briefly how nutrition affects 
health. A greater discussion of this will follow in subsequent 
chapters in this book, as there is an enormous amount of 
information regarding this aspect of lifestyle. Dietary habits include 
what a person eats, how much a person eats during a meal, how 
frequently meals are consumed, and how often a person eats out. 
Other aspects of lifestyle include physical activity level, recreational 
drug use, and sleeping patterns, all of which play a role in health and 
impact nutrition. Following a healthy lifestyle improves your overall 
health. 
Lifestyles and Nutrition  |  21
Physical Activity 
In 2008, the Health and Human Services (HHS) released the Physical 
Activity Guidelines for Americans 1 . The HHS states that “Being 
physically active is one of the most important steps that Americans 
of all ages can take to improve their health. The 2008 Physical 
Activity Guidelines for Americans provides science-based guidance 
to help Americans aged six and older improve their health through 
appropriate physical activity.” The guidelines recommend exercise 
programs for people in many different stages of their lifecycle. The 
HHS reports that there is strong evidence that increased physical 
activity decreases the risk of early death, heart disease, stroke, 
Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers; prevents 
weight gain and falls; and improves cognitive function in the elderly. 
These guidelines are scheduled for an update in 2018. Also unveiled 
recently are the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines, which are 
available at the website of The Canadian Society for Exercise 
Physiology2 . 
Recreational Drug Use 
Recreational drug use, which includes tobacco-smoking, electronic 
smoking device use, and alcohol consumption along with narcotic 
and other illegal drug use, has a large impact on health. Smoking

cigarettes can cause lung cancer, eleven other types of cancer, 
heart disease, and several other disorders or diseases that markedly 
decrease quality of life and increase mortality. In the United States, 
smoking causes more than four hundred thousand deaths every 
single year, which is far more than deaths associated with any other 
lifestyle component 3 . 
Also, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), excessive alcohol intake causes an estimated seventy-five 
thousand deaths per year 4 . Staying away from excessive alcohol 
intake lowers blood pressure, the risk from injury, heart disease, 
stroke, liver problems, and some types of cancer. While excessive 
alcohol consumption can be linked to poor health, consuming 
alcohol in moderation has been found to promote health such as 
reducing the risk for heart disease and Type 2 diabetes in some 
people. The United States Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) defines drinking in moderation as no more than one 
drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men5 . 
Illicit and prescription drug abuse are associated with decreased 
health and is a prominent problem in the United States. The health

effects of drug abuse can be far-reaching, including the increased 
risk of stroke, heart disease, cancer, lung disease, and liver disease6 . 
Sleeping Patterns 
Inadequate amounts of sleep, or not sleeping well, can also have 
remarkable effects on a person’s health. In fact, sleeping can affect 
your health just as much as your diet. Scientific studies have shown 
that insufficient sleep increases the risk for heart disease, Type 2 
diabetes, obesity, and depression. Abnormal breathing during sleep, 
a condition called sleep apnea, is also linked to an increased risk for 
chronic disease 7 . 
Personal Choice: The Challenge of Choosing 
Foods 
There are other factors besides environment and lifestyle that 
influence the foods you choose to eat. Different foods affect energy 
level, mood, how much is eaten, how long before you eat again, and 
if cravings are satisfied. We have talked about some of the physical 
effects of food on your body, but there are other effects too. 
Food regulates your appetite and how you feel. Multiple studies

24  |  Lifestyles and Nutrition
have demonstrated that some high fiber foods and high-protein 
foods decrease appetite by slowing the digestive process and 
prolonging the feeling of being full or satiety. The effects of 
individual foods and nutrients on mood are not backed by 
consistent scientific evidence, but in general, most studies support 
that healthier diets are associated with a decrease in depression and 
improved well-being. To date, science has not been able to track the 
exact path in the brain that occurs in response to eating a particular 
food, but it is quite clear that foods, in general, stimulate emotional 
responses in people. Food also has psychological, cultural, and 
religious significance, so your personal choices of food affect your 
mind, as well as your body. The social implications of food have a 
great deal to do with what people eat, as well as how and when. 
Special events in individual lives—from birthdays to funerals—are 
commemorated with equally special foods. Being aware of these 
forces can help people make healthier food choices—and still honor 
the traditions and ties they hold dear. 
Typically, eating kosher food means a person is Jewish; eating 
fish on Fridays during Lent means a person is Catholic; fasting 
during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar means a person 
is Muslim. On New Year’s Day, Japanese take part in an annual 
tradition of Mochitsuki also known as Mochi pounding in hopes 
of gaining good fortune over the coming year. Several hundred 
miles away in Hawai‘i, people eat poi made from pounded taro root 
with great significance in the Hawaiian culture, as it represents 
Hāloa, the ancestor of chiefs and kanaka maoli (Native Hawaiians). 
National food traditions are carried to other countries when people 
immigrate. The local cuisine in Hawai‘i would not be what it is 
today without the contributions of Japanese, Chinese, European, 
and other immigrant communities. 
Lifestyles and Nutrition  |  25
Factors that Drive Food Choices 
Along with these influences, a number of other factors affect the 
dietary choices individuals make, including: 
• Taste, texture, and appearance. Individuals have a wide range 
of tastes which influence their food choices, leading some to 
dislike milk and others to hate raw vegetables. Some foods that 
are very healthy, such as tofu, may be unappealing at first to 
many people. However, creative cooks can adapt healthy foods 
to meet most people’s taste. 
• Economics. Access to fresh fruits and vegetables may be scant, 
particularly for those who live in economically disadvantaged 
or remote areas, where cheaper food options are limited to 
convenience stores and fast food. 
• Early food experiences. People who were not exposed to 
different foods as children, or who were forced to swallow 
every last bite of overcooked vegetables, may make limited 
food choices as adults. 
• Habits. It’s common to establish eating routines, which can 
work both for and against optimal health. Habitually grabbing a 
fast food sandwich for breakfast can seem convenient, but 
might not offer substantial nutrition. Yet getting in the habit of 
drinking an ample amount of water each day can yield multiple 
benefits. 
• Culture. The culture in which one grows up affects how one 
sees food in daily life and on special occasions. 
• Geography. Where a person lives influences food choices. For 
instance, people who live in Midwestern US states have less 
access to seafood than those living along the coasts. 
• Advertising. The media greatly influences food choice by 
persuading consumers to eat certain foods. 
• Social factors. Any school lunchroom observer can testify to 
the impact of peer pressure on eating habits, and this 
26  |  Lifestyles and Nutrition
influence lasts through adulthood. People make food choices 
based on how they see others and want others to see them. For 
example, individuals who are surrounded by others who 
consume fast food are more likely to do the same. 
• Health concerns. Some people have significant food allergies, 
to peanuts for example, and need to avoid those foods. Others 
may have developed health issues which require them to follow 
a low salt diet. In addition, people who have never worried 
about their weight have a very different approach to eating 
than those who have long struggled with excess weight. 
• Emotions. There is a wide range in how emotional issues affect 
eating habits. When faced with a great deal of stress, some 
people tend to overeat, while others find it hard to eat at all. 
• Green food/Sustainability choices. Based on a growing 
understanding of diet as a public and personal issue, more and 
more people are starting to make food choices based on their 
environmental impact. Realizing that their food choices help 
shape the world, many individuals are opting for a vegetarian 
diet, or, if they do eat animal products, striving to find the 
most “cruelty-free” options possible. Purchasing local and 
organic food products and items grown through sustainable 
processes also helps shrink the size of one’s dietary footprint. 
People choose a vegetarian diet for various reasons, including 
religious doctrines, health concerns, ecological and animal welfare 
concerns, or simply because they dislike the taste of meat. There 
are different types of vegetarians, but a common theme is that 
vegetarians do not eat meat. Four common forms of vegetarianism 
are: 
1. 
2. 
Lacto-ovo vegetarian. This is the most common form. This 
type of vegetarian diet includes the animal foods eggs and 
dairy products. 
Lacto-vegetarian. This type of vegetarian diet includes dairy 
products but not eggs. 
Lifestyles and Nutrition  |  27
3. Ovo-vegetarian. This type of vegetarian diet includes eggs but 
not dairy products. 
4. Vegan. This type of vegetarian diet does not include dairy, 
eggs, or any type of animal product or animal by-product.

Achieving a Healthy Diet 
UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN 
NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM 
Achieving a healthy diet is a matter of balancing the quality and 
quantity of food that is eaten. There are five key factors that make 
up a healthful diet: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of 
each essential nutrient, as well as fiber and adequate calories. 
A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient 
at the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts 
of all nutrients. 
Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you 
get from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of 
energy you expend during your day’s activities. 
Moderation means not eating to the extremes, neither too 
much nor too little. 
Variety refers to consuming different foods from within each 
of the food groups on a regular basis. 
A healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative 
to modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh 
whole foods that have been sustaining people for generations. 
Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein, 
carbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health. 
Commercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients 
and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and 
trans fats, all of which are associated with the development of 
diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer, 
obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses. A balanced diet is a mix of food 
from the different food groups (vegetables, legumes, fruits, grains, 
protein foods, and dairy). 
30  |  Achieving a Healthy Diet
Adequacy 
An adequate diet is one that favors nutrient-dense foods. Nutrient
dense foods are defined as foods that contain many essential 
nutrients per calorie. Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of 
“empty-calorie” foods, such as sugary carbonated beverages, which 
are also called “nutrient-poor.” Nutrient-dense foods include fruits 
and vegetables, lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and 
whole grains. Choosing more nutrient-dense foods will facilitate 
weight loss, while simultaneously providing all necessary nutrients. 
Balance 
Balance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails 
not consuming one nutrient at the expense of another. For example, 
calcium is essential for healthy teeth and bones, but too much 
calcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are 
good sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to 
get the necessary amounts of calcium and iron from your diet, a 
proper balance between food choices is critical. Another example 
is that while sodium is an essential nutrient, excessive intake may 
contribute to congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease 
in some people. Remember, everything must be consumed in the 
proper amounts. 
Moderation 
Eat in moderation. Moderation is crucial for optimal health and 
survival. Eating nutrient-poor foods each night for dinner will lead 
to health complications. But as part of an otherwise healthful diet 
and consumed only on a weekly basis, this should not significantly 
Achieving a Healthy Diet  |  31
impact overall health. It’s important to remember that eating is, in 
part, about enjoyment and indulging with a spirit of moderation. 
This fits within a healthy diet. 
Monitor food portions. For optimum weight maintenance, it is 
important to ensure that energy consumed from foods meets the 
energy expenditures required for body functions and activity. If not, 
the excess energy contributes to gradual, steady accumulation of 
stored body fat and weight gain. In order to lose body fat, you need 
to ensure that more calories are burned than consumed. Likewise, 
in order to gain weight, calories must be eaten in excess of what is 
expended daily. 
Variety 
Variety involves eating different foods from all the food groups. 
Eating a varied diet helps to ensure that you consume and absorb 
adequate amounts of all essential nutrients required for health. One 
of the major drawbacks of a monotonous diet is the risk of 
consuming too much of some nutrients and not enough of others. 
Trying new foods can also be a source of pleasure—you never know 
what foods you might like until you try them. 
Developing a healthful diet can be rewarding, but be mindful that 
all of the principles presented must be followed to derive maximal 
health benefits. For instance, introducing variety in your diet can 
still result in the consumption of too many high-calorie, nutrient 
poor foods and inadequate nutrient intake if you do not also employ 
moderation and calorie control. Using all of these principles 
together will promote lasting health benefits.

Nutritional scientists discover the health effects of food and its 
nutrients by first making an observation. Once observations are 
made, they come up with a hypothesis, test their hypothesis, and 
then interpret the results. After this, they gather additional evidence 
from multiple sources and finally come up with a conclusion. This 
organized process of inquiry used in science is called the scientific 
method. 
34  |  Research and the Scientific
 Method
Figure 1.2 Scientific Method Steps 
Scientific 
Method steps 
In 1811, French chemist Bernard Courtois was isolating saltpeter for 
producing gunpowder to be used by Napoleon’s army. To carry out 
this isolation, he burned some seaweed and in the process, observed 
an intense violet vapor that crystallized when he exposed it to a cold 
surface. He sent the violet crystals to an expert on gases, Joseph 
Gay-Lussac, who identified the crystal as a new element. It was 
named iodine, the Greek word for violet. The following scientific 
record is some of what took place in order to conclude that iodine 
is a nutrient. 
Observation. Eating seaweed is a cure for goiter, a gross 
enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck. 
Hypothesis. In 1813, Swiss physician Jean-Francois Coindet 
hypothesized that the seaweed contained iodine, and that iodine 
could be used instead of seaweed to treat his patients 1 . 
1. Zimmerman, M.B. (2008). Research on Iodine Deficiency 
and Goiter in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries. Journal 
Research and the Scientific Method  |  35
Experimental test. Coindet administered iodine tincture orally to 
his patients with goiter. 
Interpret results. Coindet’s iodine treatment was successful. 
Hypothesis. French chemist Chatin proposed that the low iodine 
content in food and water in certain areas far away from the ocean 
was the primary cause of goiter, and renounced the theory that 
goiter was the result of poor hygiene. 
Experimental test. In the late 1860s the program, “The stamping
out of goiter,” started with people in several villages in France being 
given iodine tablets. 
Results. The program was effective and 80 percent of goitrous 
children were cured. 
Hypothesis. In 1918, Swiss doctor Bayard proposed iodizing salt as 
a good way to treat areas endemic with goiter. 
Experimental test. Iodized salt was transported by mules to a 
small village at the base of the Matterhorn where more than 75 
percent of school children were goitrous. It was given to families to 
use for six months. 
Results. The iodized salt was beneficial in treating goiter in this 
remote population. 
Experimental test. Physician David Marine conducted the first 
experiment of treating goiter with iodized salt in America in Akron, 
Ohio. 2

36  |  Research and the Scientific Method
Results. This study was conducted on over four-thousand school 
children, and found that iodized salt prevented goiter. 
Conclusions. Seven other studies similar to Marine’s were 
conducted in Italy and Switzerland, which also demonstrated the 
effectiveness of iodized salt in treating goiter. In 1924, US public 
health officials initiated the program of iodizing salt and started 
eliminating the scourge of goiter. Today, more than 70% of American 
households use iodized salt and many other countries have followed 
the same public health strategy to reduce the health consequences 
of iodine deficiency. 
Career Connection 
What are some of the ways in which you think like a 
scientist, and use the scientific method in your everyday 
life? Any decision-making process uses some aspect of the 
scientific method. Think about some of the major decisions 
you have made in your life and the research you conducted 
that supported your decision. For example, what brand of 
computer do you own? Where is your money invested? 
What college do you attend? 
Evidence-Based Approach to Nutrition 
It took more than one hundred years from iodine’s discovery as 
an effective treatment for goiter until public health programs 
recognized it as such. Although a lengthy process, the scientific 
method is a productive way to define essential nutrients and 
determine their ability to promote health and prevent disease. The 
Research and the Scientific Method  |  37
scientific method is part of the overall evidence-based approach to 
designing nutritional guidelines 3 . An evidence-based approach to 
nutrition includes 4 : 
• Defining the problem or uncertainty (e.g., the incidence of 
goiter is lower in people who consume seaweed) 
• Formulating it as a question (e.g., Does eating seaweed 
decrease the risk of goiter?) 
• Setting criteria for quality evidence 
• Evaluating the body of evidence 
• Summarizing the body of evidence and making decisions 
• Specifying the strength of the supporting evidence required to 
make decisions 
• Disseminating the findings 
The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, a 
nonprofit, non-governmental organization, constructs its nutrient 
recommendations (i.e., Dietary Reference Intakes, or DRI) using an 
evidence-based approach to nutrition. The entire procedure for 
setting the DRI is documented and made available to the public. 
The same approach is used by the USDA and HHS, which are

NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM 
There are various types of scientific studies on humans that can 
be used to provide supporting evidence for a particular hypothesis. 
These include epidemiological studies, interventional clinical trials, 
and randomized clinical trials. Valuable nutrition knowledge also is 
obtained from animal studies and cellular and molecular biology 
research.

Description 
Observational 
study of 
populations 
around the 
world and the 
impact of 
nutrition on 
health. 
Scientific 
investigations 
where a 
variable is 
changed 
between 
groups. 
Participants 
are assigned 
by chance to 
separate 
groups that 
compare 
different 
treatments. 
Neither the 
researchers 
nor the 
participants 
can choose 
which group a 
participant is 
assigned. 
Studies are 
conducted on 
animals or on 
cells. 
Example 
Diets with a high 
consumption of 
saturated fat are 
associated with an 
increased risk of 
heart attacks. 
Testing the effect 
of different diets 
on blood pressure. 
One group 
consumes an 
American diet, 
group 2 eats a diet 
rich in fruits and 
vegetables, and 
group 3 eats a 
combination of 
groups 1 and 2. 
Testing the effect 
of calcium 
supplements on 
women with 
osteoporosis. 
Participants are 
given a pill daily of 
a placebo or 
calcium 
supplement. 
Neither the 
participant nor 
the researcher 
know what group 
the participant is 
in. 
Testing the effects 
of a new blood 
pressure drug on 
guinea pigs or on 
the lipid 
membrane of a 
cell. 
Notes 
Does not 
determine 
cause-and-effect 
relationships. 
If done correctly, 
it does 
determine 
cause-and-effect 
relationships. 
Considered the 
“gold” standard 
for scientific 
studies. 
Less expensive 
than human 
trials. Study is 
not on whole 
humans so it 
may be not 
applicable.

Nutrition Assessment 
Nutritional assessment is the interpretation of anthropometric, 
biochemical (laboratory), clinical and dietary data to determine 
whether a person or groups of people are well nourished or 
malnourished (overnourished or undernourished). 
Nutritional assessment can be done using the ABCD methods. 
These refer to the following: 
• A. Anthropometry 
• B. Biochemical methods 
• C. Clinical methods 
• D. Dietary methods 
Anthropometry methods of assessing nutritional 
status 
The word anthropometry comes from two words: Anthropo means 
‘human’ and metry means ‘measurement’. The different 
measurements taken to assess growth and body composition are 
presented below. 
height, 
To assess growth, several different measurements including 
length, 
weight, 
head 
circumference, 
mid-arm 
circumference, skin-fold thickness, head/chest ratio, and hip/waist 
ratio can be used. Height and weight measurements are essential in 
children to evaluate physical growth. As an additional resource, the

status of

children) 
Biochemical methods of assessing nutritional 
status 
Biochemical or laboratory methods of assessment include 
measuring a nutrient or its metabolite in the blood, feces, urine or 
other tissues that have a relationship with the nutrient. An example 
of this method would be to take blood samples to measure levels 
of glucose in the body. This method is useful for determining if an 
individual has diabetes.

Clinical methods of assessing nutritional status 
In addition to the anthropometric assessments, you can also assess 
clinical signs and symptoms that might indicate potential specific 
nutrient deficiency. Special attention are given to organs such as 
skin, eyes, tongue, ears, mouth, hair, nails, and gums. Clinical 
methods of assessing nutritional status involve checking signs of 
deficiency at specific places on the body or asking the patient 
whether they have any symptoms that might suggest nutrient 
deficiency. 
Dietary methods of assessing nutritional status 
Dietary methods of assessment include looking at past or current 
intakes of nutrients from food by individuals or a group to 
determine their nutritional status. There are several methods used 
to do this: 
Types of Scientific Studies  |  45
24 hour recall 
A trained professional asks the subject to recall all food and drink 
consumed in the previous 24 hours. This is a quick and easy method. 
However, it is dependent upon the subject’s short-term memory 
and may not be very accurate. 
Food frequency questionnaire 
The subject is given a list of foods and asked to indicate intake per 
day, per week, and per month. This method is inexpensive and easy 
to administer. It is more accurate than the 24 hour recall. 
Food Diary 
Food intake is recorded by the subject at the time of eating. This 
method is reliable but difficult to maintain. Also known as a food 
journal or food record. 
Observed food consumption 
This method requires food to be weighed and exactly calculated. It 
is very accurate but rarely used because it is time-consuming and 
expensive. 
Evolving Science 
Science is always moving forward, albeit sometimes slowly. One 
study is not enough to make a guideline or a recommendation, or 
46  |  Types of Scientific Studies
cure a disease. Science is a stepwise process that builds on past 
evidence and finally culminates into a well-accepted conclusion. 
Unfortunately, not all scientific conclusions are developed in the 
interest of human health, and some can be biased. Therefore, it is 
important to know where a scientific study was conducted and who 
provided the funding, as this can have an impact on the scientific 
conclusions being made. For example, an air quality study paid for 
by a tobacco company diminishes its value in the minds of readers 
as well as a red meat study performed at a laboratory funded by a 
national beef association. 
Nutritional Science Evolution 
One of the newest areas in the realm of nutritional science is the 
scientific 
discipline 
of 
nutritional 
genetics, 
also 
called 
nutrigenomics. Genes are part of DNA and contain the genetic 
information that make up all of our traits. Genes are codes for 
proteins and when they are turned “on” or “off,” they change how 
the body works. While we know that health is defined as more than 
just the absence of disease, there are currently very few accurate 
genetic markers of good health. Rather, there are many more 
genetic markers for disease. However, science is evolving, and 
nutritional genetics aims to identify what nutrients to eat to “turn 
on” healthy genes and “turn off” genes that cause disease. 
Using Science and Technology to Change the 
Future 
As science evolves, so does technology. Both can be used to create a 
healthy diet, optimize health, and prevent disease. Picture yourself 
not too far into the future: you are wearing a small “dietary watch” 
Types of Scientific Studies  |  47
that painlessly samples your blood, and downloads the information 
to your cell phone, which has an app that evaluates the nutrient 
profile of your blood and then recommends a snack or dinner menu 
to assure you maintain adequate nutrient levels. What else is not 
far off? How about another app that provides a shopping list that 
adheres to all dietary guidelines and is emailed to the central server 
at your local grocer, who then delivers the food to your home? The 
food is then stored in your smart fridge which documents your 
daily diet at home and delivers your weekly dietary assessment to 
your home computer. At your computer, you can compare your diet 
with other diets aimed at weight loss, optimal strength training, 
reduction in risk for specific diseases or any other health goals you 
may have. You also may delve into the field of nutritional genetics 
and download your gene expression profiles to a database that 
analyzes your genes against millions of others. 
Nutrition and the Media 
A motivational speaker once said, “A smart person believes half of 
what they read. An intelligent person knows which half to believe.” 
In this age of information, where instant Internet access is just a 
click away, it is easy to be misled if you do not know where to go for 
reliable nutrition information. 
Using Eyes of Discernment 
“New study shows that margarine contributes to arterial plaque.” 
“Asian study reveals that two cups of coffee per day can have 
detrimental effects on the nervous system.” 
How do you react when you read news of this nature? Do you 
boycott margarine and coffee? When reading nutrition-related 
48  |  Types of Scientific Studies
claims, articles, websites, or advertisements, always remember that 
one study does not substantiate a fact. One study neither proves 
nor disproves anything. Readers who may be looking for complex 
answers to nutritional dilemmas can quickly misconstrue such 
statements and be led down a path of misinformation. Listed below 
are ways that you can develop discerning eyes when reading 
nutritional news. 
1.

The scientific study under discussion should be published in a 
peer reviewed journal, such as the Journal of Nutrition. 
Question studies that come from less trustworthy sources 
(such as non peer-reviewed journals or websites) or that are 
not formally published. 
The report should disclose the methods used by the 
researcher(s). Did the study last for three or thirty weeks? 
Were there ten or one hundred participants? What did the 
participants actually do? Did the researcher(s) observe the 
results themselves or did they rely on self reports from 
program participants? 
Who were the subjects of this study? Humans or animals? If 
human, are any traits/characteristics noted? You may realize 
you have more in common with certain program participants 
and can use that as a basis to gauge if the study applies to you. 
Credible reports often disseminate new findings in the context 
of previous research. A single study on its own gives you very 
limited information, but if a body of literature supports a 
finding, it adds to credibility. 
Peer-reviewed articles deliver a broad perspective and are 
inclusive of findings of many studies on the exact same subject. 
When reading such news, ask yourself, “Is this making sense?” 
Even if coffee does adversely affect the nervous system, do you 
drink enough of it to see any negative effects? Remember, if a 
headline professes a new remedy for a nutrition-related topic, 
it may well be a research-supported piece of news, but more 
often than not, it is a sensational story designed to catch the 
Types of Scientific Studies  |  49
attention of an unsuspecting consumer. Track down the 
original journal article to see if it really supports the 
conclusions being drawn in the news report. 
When reading information on websites, remember the following 
criteria for discerning if the site is valid:

Who sponsors the website? 
Are names and credentials disclosed? 
Is an editorial board identified? 
Does the site contain links to other credible informational 
websites? 
Even better, does it reference peer-reviewed journal articles? 
If so, do those journal articles actually back up the claims being 
made on the website?

Are you being sold something at this website? 
Does the website charge a fee?
