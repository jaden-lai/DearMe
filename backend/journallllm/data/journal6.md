If you could live anywhere in the world, where would that be? Could you realistically live there? If not, are you happy where you live now, or is there somewhere you can  move that you think will make you happy? Or is there anything you can do to make where you live now better?

Take a second to reflect on your relationships with friends, family, romantic partners, etc. Do you feel happy and fulfilled by these bonds? Why or why not? 

What are your hobbies? Do you feel like you need a few new ones or want to pick up old ones you haven’t done in a while?

If a stranger saw you on the street, what do you think they might assume about you? What might they think you were feeling? Does it match with what you’re actually feeling? 

Describe the last time you were really proud of yourself. Can you find that sense of pride again? Are there other things you can do—or expectations you can shift around—to get that sense of pride?
